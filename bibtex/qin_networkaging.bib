Global screens for age regulation have been performed for worms and flies, as well as many tissues in mice and humans. Recent work has begun to analyze the similarities and differences in transcriptional changes in aging among different species. Most age-related expression changes are specific for a given species, but genes in one pathway (the electron transport chain pathway) show common age regulation in species from worms to humans. Evolutionary theories of aging provide a basis to understand how age regulation of a genetic pathway might be preserved between distantly related species.},

Observations challenging the fundamental assumptions of aging have begun to rejuvenate the field, opening up aging research to fresh ideas and approaches. Genetic approaches, which have been successfully used to understand other complex biological phenomena, are beginning to reveal important patterns and conservations between the processes of aging in a variety of species including yeast, nematodes, flies, and mice. A combination of candidate and random gene alteration approaches, particularly in the fruitfly model system, Drosophila melanogaster, should prove to be especially valuable for elucidating the primary physiological systems involved in aging and life span determination.},

@article{Ghaemmaghami2003Nature,
	Abstract = {The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

@article{Newman2006Nature,
	Abstract = {A major goal of biology is to provide a quantitative description of cellular behaviour. This task, however, has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring protein abundances and their variation. Here we present a strategy that pairs high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged yeast strains to monitor rapidly and precisely protein levels at single-cell resolution. Bulk protein abundance measurements of >2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function. For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas those involved in protein synthesis are quiet. Thus, these studies reveal a remarkable structure to biological noise and suggest that protein noise levels have been selected to reflect the costs and potential benefits of this variation.},

@article{Lorenz2009PNAS,
	Abstract = {In this study, a reverse-engineering strategy was used to infer and analyze the structure and function of an aging and glucose repressed gene regulatory network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method uses transcriptional perturbations to model the functional interactions between genes as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The resulting network model correctly identified the known interactions of key regulators in a 10-gene network from the Snf1 signaling pathway, which is required for expression of glucose-repressed genes upon calorie restriction. The majority of interactions predicted by the network model were confirmed using promoter-reporter gene fusions in gene-deletion mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing a more complex network architecture than previously appreciated. The reverse-engineered network model also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase enzyme/transcriptional repressor Hxk2, Mediator subunit Med8, and transcriptional repressor Mig1. These interactions were validated experimentally and used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as modulators of chronological lifespan. This work demonstrates the value of using network inference methods to identify and characterize the regulators of complex phenotypes, such as aging.},

@article{Wang10CB,
	Abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle to senescence. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 10(5) individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

@article{Kowald94JTB,
	Abstract = {Many different theories of ageing have been proposed, based often on highly specific molecular causes. Recent advances in evolutionary theory support the idea that ageing is caused by progressive accumulation of defects, but indicate that multiple processes are likely to operate in parallel. This calls for an understanding of ageing and longevity in terms of a network of maintenance processes that controls the capability of the system to preserve homeostasis. Here we develop a theoretical model which begins the task of implementing a Network Theory of Ageing. To do this the model integrates the ideas of the Free Radical Theory, describing the reactions of free radicals, antioxidants and proteolytic enzymes, with the Protein Error Theory, describing the error propagation loops within the cellular translation machinery. The simulations show that an increased radical production and/or insufficient radical protection can destabilize an otherwise stable translation system. The model supports the idea that caloric restriction prolongs life via a reduction of the generation of radicals. Another result of the model is that protein half-life increases with time as a natural consequence of the interaction between proteolytic enzymes and radicals. Finally the model strengthens certain evolutionary ageing theories by showing that there is a positive correlation between maintenance related energy consumption and lifespan.},

The most important part of the review summarizes our knowledge on the aging of networks. The effects of aging on the general network models are described, as well as the initial findings on the effects of aging on the cellular networks. Finally we suggest a 'weak link theory of aging' linking the random damage of the network constituents to the overwhelming majority of the low affinity, transient interactions (weak links) in the cellular networks. We show that random damage of weak links may lead to an increase of noise and an increased vulnerability of cellular networks, and make a comparison between these predictions and the observed behaviour of the emergent properties of cellular networks in aged organisms.},

@article{Soti07EG,
	Abstract = {We increasingly rely on the network approach to understand the complexity of cellular functions. Chaperones (heat shock proteins) are key "networkers", which sequester and repair damaged proteins. In order to link the network approach and chaperones with the aging process, we first summarize the properties of aging networks suggesting a "weak link theory of aging". This theory suggests that age-related random damage primarily affects the overwhelming majority of the low affinity, transient interactions (weak links) in cellular networks leading to increased noise, destabilization and diversity. These processes may be further amplified by age-specific network remodelling and by the sequestration of weakly linked cellular proteins to protein aggregates of aging cells. Chaperones are weakly linked hubs (i.e., network elements with a large number of connections) and inter-modular bridge elements of protein-protein interaction, signalling and mitochondrial networks. As aging proceeds, the increased overload of damaged proteins is an especially important element contributing to cellular disintegration and destabilization. Additionally, chaperone overload may contribute to the increase of "noise" in aging cells, which leads to an increased stochastic resonance resulting in a deficient discrimination between signals and noise. Chaperone- and other multi-target therapies, which restore the missing weak links in aging cellular networks, may emerge as important anti-aging interventions.},

The equation is applied to the computation of ab initio ("from the beginning") life tables for four natural populations of ungulates--wild boar, Dall sheep, African buffalo, and hippopotamus--which represent a broad range of survival characteristics. The good agreement of the ab initio and empirical tables, the best available for testing the theory, demonstrates the basic realism of the wearout equation.

	Abstract = {Gompertz' age-related exponential increase in mortality rate and the obdurately flat mortality trajectory of Drosophila are paradoxical notions for metazoan aging theory. A multiclonal model of Gompertzian organisms provides a resolution by assuming that (a) conception initiates a stochastic process producing a train of replications of fixed length (the Hayflick limit); (b) unique stem cells arise early on to generate multiple vital clones; (c) life continues until one such clone critically depletes its replicative potential. Lifespan is thus governed by the time it takes to reach the terminal branches of the mitotic tree. Although these times are not independent, asymptotic independence can be justified. This clears the way for asymptotic extreme-value theory to guarantee: (1) a non-increasing failure rate, under unlimited replicability; (2) an exponentially increasing failure rate, under limited replicability. However, to obtain an exact fit to the human force-of-mortality function also requires the inclusion of the phenomenon of mitotic deceleration (implemented with a lognormal model of replication).the sine qua non of Gompertzian mortality is cellular aging, expressed through these two mitotic phenomena. Conversely, those metazoa with unlimited cellular replicability, by staving off clonal failure would succumb only to catastrophic, age-independent events, yielding a constant mortality rate, the signature of a mitotic clock that does not run down.},

	Abstract = {A "bingo" model is one in which the pattern of survival of a system is determined by whichever of several components, each with its own particular distribution for survival, fails first. The model is motivated by the study of lifespan in animals. A number of properties of such systems are discussed in general. They include the use of a special criterion of skewness that probably corresponds more closely than traditional measures to what the eye observes in casually inspecting data. This criterion is the ratio, r(h), of the probability density at a point an arbitrary distance, h, above the mode to that an equal distance below the mode. If this ratio is positive for all positive arguments, the distribution is considered positively asymmetrical and conversely. Details of the bingo model are worked out for several types of base distributions: the rectangular, the triangular, the logistic, and by numerical methods, the normal, lognormal, and gamma.},

@article{Morales:1984:Am-J-Med-Genet:6720745,
	Abstract = {Some Mendelian disorders (Huntington chorea, hereditary polyposis coli) are not manifest at birth but show a distribution in the age of onset. Patients at risk fall into three groups. In type I, they are affected when first examined. In type II, they are not affected at one visit, but are at a later visit. Those of type III (who comprise an indistinguishable mixture of those who have, and those who have not, inherited the gene) are never found to be affected. This paper posits a model that the age of onset is logistic. (It is a degenerate bingo model in which competing causes of death may be ignored.) The statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are explored by Monte Carlo simulation of this logistic function with known arbitrary parameters. Two schemes are used: point-prevalence (or synchronic) data of types I and III, and piecewise longitudinal (diachronic) data; this allows all three types to be included. Samples of various sizes between 25 and 100 are used. While estimates of the parameters are positively biased (especially with small samples), the estimate of the mean appears to be consistent, almost unbiased, and fairly precise, though somewhat larger than the estimates from the lower bound (a fact that calls for some caution in interpreting actual data). The MLE was applied to 109 patients with the Gardner syndrome (GS); measures of variability found by applying MLE to four random subsets of 25 each were compared against the asymptotic estimates. The analysis was also applied to 36 persons with familial polyposis coli (FPC). The mean age of onset in GS and FPC was similar, and since they are rather earlier than is currently believed, it is recommended that regular supervision be started at not later than 10 years of age.},

	Abstract = {The survivorship (time to death or failure) of a bingo-gamma (BG) model is defined as the minimum among the waiting times for completion among k independent gamma processes. The ith process is of order ni, with a mean rate for the occurrence of hits of ai. In this paper we address the case where, for all competing processes, the order and the rate at which hits occur are the same but both they and k are unknown. We denote by k the multiplicity, by n the order or the number of hits to failure, and by a the transition parameter. The joint maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the three parameters of this BG process is developed. An algorithm for calculating it has been devised and a computer program in BASIC has been written. The properties of the MLE have been explored systematically, mainly by Monte Carlo simulation. The distributions, means, variances, covariances, and correlation coefficients of the three parameters are explored for samples of size 25 and samples of size 100. Also, the simple average of the observed survival times (which gives a method of moments estimator of the mean survival) is compared with the MLE of the mean survival; the two estimators seem to be unbiased and about equally efficient.},

A distinction is made between an idealized pathogenetic model, which aims to represent the disease in as much authentic detail as the present state of knowledge allows and in components that have literal interpretation, and an empirical model, which deals with those effects of the pathogenetic model that one may hope to observe clinically. We review a variety of empirical models distinguishable by the amount of data available on intermediate degrees of damage short of total destruction. The relationship of damage to time is explored, and we consider the criteria and usefulness of linearization of this relationship where the diachronic ("longitudinal") data are few and extend over a comparatively short time. Every time a patient is examined, the degree of cumulative damage is assessed in each of the body systems of interest. Thus the examination will furnish a set of measurements, which is obtained on each of several examinations, taken over a period that for preference is long relative to the survival of the system. Specific disorders discussed include dentition and enlargement of the aorta with age in the Marfan syndrome.},

If the rate of waste production is sufficient, the population size approaches an asymptote as in phase III growth in vitro. If a lower rate of waste production allows the cells to outmultiply the waste, growth is unlimited as in a transformed cell population. The asymptotic population size and the threshold for unlimited growth are remarkably sensitive to small changes in the values of the two rate parameters unless the ratio of their values is constant. This suggests that there may be a cellular mechanism that relates the waste production and cell division rates.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we shall attempt to quantify the rather abstractly and ambiguously used concepts of acceleration of aging and rate or velocity of aging. The use of the phrase "rate of aging", in the gerontological literature, requires that we formalize the concepts so that they may be discussed in a uniform manner. We shall perform this formalization by means of an analogy with various similar concepts from the discipline of physics. This set of analogies leads, quite naturally, to some practical ways in which we may discuss the acceleration of aging. Additionally, these analogies allow us to introduce two forms of acceleration of aging; uniform and non-uniform acceleration. By uniform acceleration, we shall see that we mean an acceleration which is independent of the age of the individual in the population. That is, every individual in the population feels the same magnitude of acceleration, no matter what his age. Non-uniform acceleration is an acceleration which is age-dependent. We shall introduce the concepts of relative acceleration and fraction relative acceleration as a means of deciding whether a population is undergoing uniform or non-uniform acceleration. Finally, these new developments will be applied to C. elegans, to rat, and to C57BL/6J mouse experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Major US demographers predict that, by the year 2010, the United States will have attained zero population growth. They further predict that, by that time, more than half the U.S. population will be over the age of 40. Along with this dynamic change in the underlying age structure of the population comes an increasing body of evidence which supports the correlation between chronological age of the host and incidence of a variety of human cancers. Not only does cancer affect the older age group in a disproportionate manner but, as we have already noted, our nation's number of older individuals is increasing. In 1900, the number of individuals over 65 years of age was 3.1 million. By 2030 this number is expected to reach 55 million. Hence, there will be an increasing need for cancer treatment and cancer care among the older segment of the population. This chapter addresses some of the issues of the modeling and the simulation of the interplay of aging normal tissues and cancer processes. We will illustrate some simply preliminary results and will show how these might be extended to address some of the more complex questions arising in this intriguing interface.},

	Abstract = {A general measure of the rate of senescence is the acceleration of mortality rate, represented here by the time required for the mortality rate to double (MRD). Rhesus monkeys have an MRD close to that of humans, about 8 years; their shorter life-span results mainly from higher mortality at all ages. In contrast, some groups with short life-spans (rodents and galliform birds) have shorter MRDs and faster senescence. On the basis of the Gompertz mortality rate model, one may estimate the MRD from the maximum life-span (tmax) and the overall population mortality rate. Such calculations show that certain birds have MRDs that are as long as that of humans. These results show that high overall mortality rates or small body sizes do not preclude slow rates of senescence.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of cellular metabolism is used to relate the rates of cell division and waste production to the concentrations of oxygen and glucose in the medium in which a normal diploid cell culture is grown. The metabolic model in tandem with an earlier waste-content model based on the waste-product theory of aging provides a unified cell-culture model with which population size and intracellular waste content can be calculated. Population size is measured by the number of population doublings which have been achieved. After suitable adjustment of parameters in the metabolic model, maximum values of population size are calculated numerically with the use of the unified model. Results show that the population maxima are related in a plausible way to the oxygen and glucose concentrations. The effects of temperature changes and contact inhibition of growth are also simulated. Small changes in the cell-division and waste-production rates can cause transformation to unlimited growth in the waste-content model, but the unified model is not correspondingly sensitive to changes in the oxygen and glucose concentrations or to changes in temperature.},

	Abstract = {Studies of the biology of aging (both experimental and evolutionary) frequently involve the estimation of parameters arising in various multi-parameter survival models such as the Gompertz or Weibull distribution. Standard parameter estimation methodologies, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or nonlinear regression (NLR), require knowledge of the actual life spans or their explicit algebraic equivalents in order to provide reliable parameter estimates. Many fundamental biological discussions and conclusions are highly dependent upon accurate estimates of these survival parameters (this has historically been the case in the study of genetic and environmental effects on longevity and the evolutionary biology of aging). In this article, we examine some of the issues arising in the estimation of gerontologic survival model parameters. We not only address issues of accuracy when the original life-span data are unknown, we consider the accuracy of the estimates even when the exact life spans are known. We examine these issues as applied to known experimental data on diet restriction and we fit the frequently used, two-parameter Gompertzian survival distribution to these experimental data. Consequences of methodological misuse are demonstrated and subsequently related to the values of the final parameter estimates and their associated errors. These results generalize to other multiparametric distributions such as the Weibull, Makeham, and logistic survival distributions.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel mathematical/computational strategy for predicting genes/proteins associated with aging/longevity. The novelty of our method arises from the topological analysis of an organismal longevity gene/protein network (LGPN), which extends the existing cellular networks. The LGPN nodes represent both genes and corresponding proteins. Links stand for all known interactions between the nodes. The LGPN of C. elegans incorporated 362 genes/proteins, 160 connecting and 202 age-related ones, from a list of 321 with known impact on aging/longevity. A 'longevity core' of 129 directly interacting genes or proteins was identified. This core may shed light on the large-scale mechanisms of aging. Predictions were made, based upon the finding that LGPN hubs and centrally located nodes have higher likelihoods of being associated with aging/longevity than do randomly selected nodes.

	Abstract = {Age is the most important risk factor for neurodegeneration; however, the effects of aging and neurodegeneration on gene expression in the human brain have most often been studied separately. Here, we analyzed changes in transcript levels and alternative splicing in the temporal cortex of individuals of different ages who were cognitively normal, affected by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), or affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identified age-related splicing changes in cognitively normal individuals and found that these were present also in 95% of individuals with FTLD or AD, independent of their age. These changes were consistent with increased polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB)-dependent splicing activity. We also identified disease-specific splicing changes that were present in individuals with FTLD or AD, but not in cognitively normal individuals. These changes were consistent with the decreased neuro-oncological ventral antigen (NOVA)-dependent splicing regulation, and the decreased nuclear abundance of NOVA proteins. As expected, a dramatic down-regulation of neuronal genes was associated with disease, whereas a modest down-regulation of glial and neuronal genes was associated with aging. Whereas our data indicated that the age-related splicing changes are regulated independently of transcript-level changes, these two regulatory mechanisms affected expression of genes with similar functions, including metabolism and DNA repair. In conclusion, the alternative splicing changes identified in this study provide a new link between aging and neurodegeneration.},

Subsequently, I review the literature on the allometry of aging, and I demonstrate how my reliability model may be used to obtain--in a qualitative manner--some of the lifespan curves found in the literature.

Calorie restriction of tor1D or sch9D cells failed to further increase life span and, like calorie restriction, deletion of either SCH9 or TOR1 increased life span independent of the Sir2 histone deacetylase. We propose that the TOR and Sch9 kinases define a primary conduit through which excess nutrient intake limits longevity in yeast.},

	Abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae has directly or indirectly contributed to the identification of arguably more mammalian genes that affect aging than any other model organism. Aging in yeast is assayed primarily by measurement of replicative or chronological life span. Here, we review the genes and mechanisms implicated in these two aging model systems and key remaining issues that need to be addressed for their optimization. Because of its well-characterized genome that is remarkably amenable to genetic manipulation and high-throughput screening procedures, S. cerevisiae will continue to serve as a leading model organism for studying pathways relevant to human aging and disease.},

@article{Schleit:2012:FEBS,
	Abstract = {Calorie restriction is reported to enhance survival and delay the onset of age-related decline in many different species. Several proteins have been proposed to play a role in mediating the response to calorie restriction, including the target of rapamycin kinase, sirtuins, and AMP kinase. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of calorie restriction has popularized the concept of "calorie restriction mimetics", drugs that mimic the beneficial effects of caloire restriction without requiring a reduction in nutrient intake. In theory, such drugs should delay the onset and progression of multiple age-related diseases, similar to calorie restriction in mammals. Despite the potential benefits of such calorie restriction mimetics, however, relatively little is known about the interaction between genetic variation and individual response to calorie restriction. Limited evidence from model systems indicates that genotype plays a large role in determining both the magnitude and direction of effect that calorie restriction has on longevity. Here we present an overview of these data from the perspective of using yeast as a model to study aging and describe an approach we are taking to further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype-dependent responses to calorie restriction.},
